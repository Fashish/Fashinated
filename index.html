      <ul>
        <li>A selector in CSS refers to a word in the CSS file that identifies
        which element the rules within the selector should apply to.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"
          target="_blank">
          CSS Reference</a> is a comprehensive document that
          lists all standard CSS properties, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements,
          @-rules, units, and selectors all in alphabetical order as well as
          showing how to use the basic syntax of each CSS rule.</li>
        <li>Another great resource for CSS documentation is <a href=
          "https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/" target="_blank">
          this article</a>
          which shows how CSS selectors work.</li>
        <li>Some CSS vocabulary:
          <div id="inner-list">
            <ul>
              <li><b>CSS</b>: Cascading Style Sheet</li>
              <li><b>Rule</b>: a line of CSS code describing the value that a
                certain attribute should use.</li>
              <li><b>Property</b>: The property you want to change.</li>
              <li><b>Value</b>: The value that you want to assign to the
                attribute</li>
              <li><b>Selector</b>: The name that you use in order to target the
                elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in
                the HTML.</li>
              <li><b>Class</b>: A class refers to a group of elements that can
                be styled together.</li>
              <li><b>ID</b>: ID's are unique identifiers that uniquely identify
                an element in HTML.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li style="color: #910000">This way of using styles is typically bad
          practice and should be avoided.</li>
        <li>Styles can either be incorporated through a CSS file separate
          to the html one with a link tag added to the head tag in the html,
          or added within the style tag at the top of the html.
        </li>
        <li>Setting the <code>box-sizing</code> attribute in the CSS to
          <code>border-box</code> makes the calculation of the element size to
        include both the border and padding.</li>
        <li>Adding the rule <code>display: flex;</code> to the appropriate
          div will override their behaviour of appearing as blocks that take
          up the entire screen and let them appear next to each other.</li>
      </ul>
